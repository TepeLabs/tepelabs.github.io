# Overview

**tepe.so** is an app that lets you use blockchain tokens to encrypt, own, and share your files on the permaweb.

To use Tepe, you will first need to get an Ethereum wallet. Here's [how](https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/#sim).

With Tepe, you can:

1. [Encrypt & upload files](#encrypt--upload-files)
2. [Download & decrypt files](#download--decrypt-files)
3. [Share your files](#share-your-files)
4. [Forge your own "lockbox" NFTs](#forge-lockbox-nfts)

## Encrypt & upload files

To encrypt and upload a file, go to the [Upload](https://tepe.so/upload) page and select a file to upload. You will be prompted to provide a signature for the [Lit Protocol](https://litprotocol.com/) to encrypt the file. The file will be uploaded to [Arweave](https://arweave.org/), which is a decentralized storage network that combines blockchain technology and data sharding to store data permanently, using [Irys](https://irys.xyz/) as an abstraction layer.

## Download & decrypt files

To download and decrypt a file, go to anyone's profile page--for example, [tepe.so/harang](https://tepe.so/harang)--and click on the file you want to download. After downloading the file from [Arweave](https://aweave.org), you will be prompted to provide a signature for the [Lit Protocol](https://litprotocol.com/) to decrypt the file.

## Share your files

To share your file, simply share your Ethereum address. Then, anyone can go to your profile page at `tepe.so/<your_ethereum_address>` and download your files.

To make sharing even simpler, edit your profile, and add a username. Then, anyone can go to your profile page at `tepe.so/<your_username>` and download your files.
